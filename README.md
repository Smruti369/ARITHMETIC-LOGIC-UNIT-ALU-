Built a compact 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog.
Ran the design inside EDAâ€¯Playground using Aldec Rivirea pro 2023 24
 In this task i perform the airthmatic and logical operators .
Airthmatic Operations : Addition,Substraction
Logical Operation : AND ,OR,NOR
 How I verified it:
Wrote a testbench (alu_tb.v) that applies various test cases to each operation.
Used waveforms to visually confirm that each function works correctly.
